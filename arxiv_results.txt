Title : Online Risk-Averse Planning in POMDPs Using Iterated CVaR Value Function
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20554v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
We study risk-sensitive planning under partial observability using the dynamic risk measure Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR). A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $α$, where $α= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $α< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.

Title : Securing AI Agents in Cyber-Physical Systems: A Survey of Environmental Interactions, Deepfake Threats, and Defenses
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20184v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
The increasing integration of AI agents into cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduces new security risks that extend beyond traditional cyber or physical threat models. Recent advances in generative AI enable deepfake and semantic manipulation attacks that can compromise agent perception, reasoning, and interaction with the physical environment, while emerging protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) further expand the attack surface through dynamic tool use and cross-domain context sharing. This survey provides a comprehensive review of security threats targeting AI agents in CPS, with a particular focus on environmental interactions, deepfake-driven attacks, and MCP-mediated vulnerabilities. We organize the literature using the SENTINEL framework, a lifecycle-aware methodology that integrates threat characterization, feasibility analysis under CPS constraints, defense selection, and continuous validation. Through an end-to-end case study grounded in a real-world smart grid deployment, we quantitatively illustrate how timing, noise, and false-positive costs constrain deployable defenses, and why detection mechanisms alone are insufficient as decision authorities in safety-critical CPS. The survey highlights the role of provenance- and physics-grounded trust mechanisms and defense-in-depth architectures, and outlines open challenges toward trustworthy AI-enabled CPS.

Title : On the Analysis of Platooned Vehicular Networks on Highways
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19370v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
Vehicular platooning refers to coordinated and close movement of vehicular users (VUs) traveling together along a common route segment, offering strategic benefits such as reduced fuel costs, lower emissions, and improved traffic flow. {Highways offer a natural setting for platooning due to extended travel distances, yet their potential remains underexplored, particularly in terms of communication and connectivity. Given that effective platooning relies on robust vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, understanding connectivity dynamics on highways is essential.} In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of vehicular platooning on a highway and its impact on the performance of two forms of vehicular communications -- namely V2V and V2I communication -- compared to independent vehicle movement on a highway. The vehicular networks consists of road-side units (RSUs), modeled as a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), to provide the vehicular connectivity to the VUs. VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations and provide numerical insights into the impact of different traffic patterns on RSU load distribution, CP, and RC performance.

Title : TEA-Bench: A Systematic Benchmarking of Tool-enhanced Emotional Support Dialogue Agent
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18700v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
Emotional Support Conversation requires not only affective expression but also grounded instrumental support to provide trustworthy guidance. However, existing ESC systems and benchmarks largely focus on affective support in text-only settings, overlooking how external tools can enable factual grounding and reduce hallucination in multi-turn emotional support. We introduce TEA-Bench, the first interactive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented agents in ESC, featuring realistic emotional scenarios, an MCP-style tool environment, and process-level metrics that jointly assess the quality and factual grounding of emotional support. Experiments on nine LLMs show that tool augmentation generally improves emotional support quality and reduces hallucination, but the gains are strongly capacity-dependent: stronger models use tools more selectively and effectively, while weaker models benefit only marginally. We further release TEA-Dialog, a dataset of tool-enhanced ESC dialogues, and find that supervised fine-tuning improves in-distribution support but generalizes poorly. Our results underscore the importance of tool use in building reliable emotional support agents.

Title : Faramesh: A Protocol-Agnostic Execution Control Plane for Autonomous Agent Systems
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17744v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
Autonomous agent systems increasingly trigger real-world side effects: deploying infrastructure, modifying databases, moving money, and executing workflows. Yet most agent stacks provide no mandatory execution checkpoint where organizations can deterministically permit, deny, or defer an action before it changes reality. This paper introduces Faramesh, a protocol-agnostic execution control plane that enforces execution-time authorization for agent-driven actions via a non-bypassable Action Authorization Boundary (AAB). Faramesh canonicalizes agent intent into a Canonical Action Representation (CAR), evaluates actions deterministically against policy and state, and issues a decision artifact (PERMIT/DEFER/DENY) that executors must validate prior to execution. The system is designed to be framework- and model-agnostic, supports multi-agent and multi-tenant deployments, and remains independent of transport protocols (e.g., MCP). Faramesh further provides decision-centric, append-only provenance logging keyed by canonical action hashes, enabling auditability, verification, and deterministic replay without re-running agent reasoning. We show how these primitives yield enforceable, predictable governance for autonomous execution while avoiding hidden coupling to orchestration layers or observability-only approaches.

Title : Breaking the Protocol: Security Analysis of the Model Context Protocol Specification and Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities in Tool-Integrated LLM Agents
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17549v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a de facto standard for integrating Large Language Models with external tools, yet no formal security analysis of the protocol specification exists. We present the first rigorous security analysis of MCP's architectural design, identifying three fundamental protocol-level vulnerabilities: (1) absence of capability attestation allowing servers to claim arbitrary permissions, (2) bidirectional sampling without origin authentication enabling server-side prompt injection, and (3) implicit trust propagation in multi-server configurations. We implement \textsc{MCPBench}, a novel framework bridging existing agent security benchmarks to MCP-compliant infrastructure, enabling direct measurement of protocol-specific attack surfaces. Through controlled experiments on 847 attack scenarios across five MCP server implementations, we demonstrate that MCP's architectural choices amplify attack success rates by 23--41\% compared to equivalent non-MCP integrations. We propose \textsc{MCPSec}, a backward-compatible protocol extension adding capability attestation and message authentication, reducing attack success rates from 52.8\% to 12.4\% with median latency overhead of 8.3ms per message. Our findings establish that MCP's security weaknesses are architectural rather than implementation-specific, requiring protocol-level remediation.

Title : Prompt Injection Attacks on Agentic Coding Assistants: A Systematic Analysis of Vulnerabilities in Skills, Tools, and Protocol Ecosystems
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17548v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
The proliferation of agentic AI coding assistants, including Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and emerging skill-based architectures, has fundamentally transformed software development workflows. These systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with external tools, file systems, and shell access through protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). However, this expanded capability surface introduces critical security vulnerabilities. In this \textbf{Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)} paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of prompt injection attacks targeting agentic coding assistants. We propose a novel three-dimensional taxonomy categorizing attacks across \textit{delivery vectors}, \textit{attack modalities}, and \textit{propagation behaviors}. Our meta-analysis synthesizes findings from 78 recent studies (2021--2026), consolidating evidence that attack success rates against state-of-the-art defenses exceed 85\% when adaptive attack strategies are employed. We systematically catalog 42 distinct attack techniques spanning input manipulation, tool poisoning, protocol exploitation, multimodal injection, and cross-origin context poisoning. Through critical analysis of 18 defense mechanisms reported in prior work, we identify that most achieve less than 50\% mitigation against sophisticated adaptive attacks. We contribute: (1) a unified taxonomy bridging disparate attack classifications, (2) the first systematic analysis of skill-based architecture vulnerabilities with concrete exploit chains, and (3) a defense-in-depth framework grounded in the limitations we identify. Our findings indicate that the security community must treat prompt injection as a first-class vulnerability class requiring architectural-level mitigations rather than ad-hoc filtering approaches.

Title : Pipeline Inspection, Visualization, and Interoperability in PyTerrier
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17502v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
PyTerrier provides a declarative framework for building and experimenting with Information Retrieval (IR) pipelines. In this demonstration, we highlight several recent pipeline operations that improve their ability to be programmatically inspected, visualized, and integrated with other tools (via the Model Context Protocol, MCP). These capabilities aim to make it easier for researchers, students, and AI agents to understand and use a wide array of IR pipelines.

Title : Towards a Declarative Agentic Layer for Intelligent Agents in MCP-Based Server Ecosystems
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17435v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of increasingly complex agentic and multi-agent systems capable of planning, tool use and task decomposition. However, empirical evidence shows that many of these systems suffer from fundamental reliability issues, including hallucinated actions, unexecutable plans and brittle coordination. Crucially, these failures do not stem from limitations of the underlying models themselves, but from the absence of explicit architectural structure linking goals, capabilities and execution. This paper presents a declarative, model-independent architectural layer for grounded agentic workflows that addresses this gap. The proposed layer, referred to as DALIA (Declarative Agentic Layer for Intelligent Agents), formalises executable capabilities, exposes tasks through a declarative discovery protocol, maintains a federated directory of agents and their execution resources, and constructs deterministic task graphs grounded exclusively in declared operations. By enforcing a clear separation between discovery, planning and execution, the architecture constrains agent behaviour to a verifiable operational space, reducing reliance on speculative reasoning and free-form coordination. We present the architecture and design principles of the proposed layer and illustrate its operation through a representative task-oriented scenario, demonstrating how declarative grounding enables reproducible and verifiable agentic workflows across heterogeneous environments.

Title : A Universal Large Language Model -- Drone Command and Control Interface
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15486v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) for drone control can have a transformative impact on drone capabilities, especially when real world information can be integrated with drone sensing, command, and control, part of a growing field of physical AI. Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information. This demonstrates a universal approach to integration of LLMs with drone command and control, a paradigm that leverages and exploits virtually all of modern AI industry with drone technology in an easy to use interface that translates natural language to drone control.

Title : Multi-context principal component analysis
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15239v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a tool to capture factors that explain variation in data. Across domains, data are now collected across multiple contexts (for example, individuals with different diseases, cells of different types, or words across texts). While the factors explaining variation in data are undoubtedly shared across subsets of contexts, no tools currently exist to systematically recover such factors. We develop multi-context principal component analysis (MCPCA), a theoretical and algorithmic framework that decomposes data into factors shared across subsets of contexts. Applied to gene expression, MCPCA reveals axes of variation shared across subsets of cancer types and an axis whose variability in tumor cells, but not mean, is associated with lung cancer progression. Applied to contextualized word embeddings from language models, MCPCA maps stages of a debate on human nature, revealing a discussion between science and fiction over decades. These axes are not found by combining data across contexts or by restricting to individual contexts. MCPCA is a principled generalization of PCA to address the challenge of understanding factors underlying data across contexts.

Title : Optimizing FaaS Platforms for MCP-enabled Agentic Workflows
Link  : http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14735v2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
Agentic workflows that use autonomous AI Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers is rapidly rising. This introduces challenges in scalable cloud deployment and state management. Traditional hosting on Virtual Machines (VMs) is resource-intensive and lacks elasticity. Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms offer modularity, autoscaling and cost efficiency but are inherently stateless. In this paper, we present the FAME, a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows. FAME decomposes agentic patterns such as ReAct into composable agents: Planner, Actor and Evaluator, that are each a FaaS function built using LangGraph and are orchestrated as a FaaS workflow. This enables modular composition as AWS Step Functions and avoids function timeouts seen for monolithic agentic workflows. To address context persistence across user requests in a conversation, FAME automates agent memory persistence and injection using DynamoDB. It also optimizes MCP server deployment through AWS Lambda wrappers, caches tool outputs in S3 and proposes function fusion strategies. We evaluate FAME on two representative applications, on research paper summarization and log analytics, under diverse memory and caching configurations. Results show up to 13x latency reduction, 88% fewer input tokens and 66% in cost savings, along with improved workflow completion rates. This demonstrates the viability of serverless platforms for hosting complex, multi-agent AI workflows at scale.
